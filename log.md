# 100 Days Of Machine Learning Code - Log

### Day 1: June 05, 2018 (Code 1)

**Today's Progress**: Classfied Sports car from minivans using Supervised learning and sklearn

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with ML, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Sklearn is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 2: June 06, 2018 (Code 2)

**Today's Progress**: Sucesfully Visualized a Decision Tree and learned about feature scaling 

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with the theory part of feature scaling, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.

### Day 2: June 06, 2018 (Code 3)

**Today's Progress**: Plotted Some data with matplotlib

**Thoughts**: This was easy and fun.

### Day 3: June 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I wrote my first machine learning pipeline. 
                      I wrote my first classifier from scratch for the iris dataset 

**Thoughts** I never knew what pipelines were and now i understand why they are so important. Coding the classifier was a bit tricky and required me to do some resarch on Kneighbours.
